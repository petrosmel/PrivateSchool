                <h2>Java</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere
                    (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless
                    of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
                    GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in
                    1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007,
                    in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference
                    implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source software and used by most developers including the Eclipse IDE and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions. The latest versions are Java 14, released in March
                    2020, and Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise
                    still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues.[22] Since
                    Java 9, 10, 12 and 13 are no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 14) or an LTS release.</p>

                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
                    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential
                    part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
                    functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language
                    itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs. JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers,
                    but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova. Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java,
                    including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

            <div id="main-courses-c3" class="study"><img src="../img/py.jpg" alt="Python logo">
                <h2>Python</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
                    Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[28] Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[29] Python was created in the late
                    1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the
                    language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python
                    2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release."[30] No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[31][32] With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[33] and later are supported. Python interpreters
                    are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free and open-source[34] reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and
                    directs resources for Python and CPython development.</p>

            <div id="main-courses-c4" class="study"><img src="../img/c.jpg" alt="C# logo">
                <h2>C#</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note C♯, but written with the number sign)[b] is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic,
                    object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.[17] It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002
                    and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Mono is the name of the free and open-source project to develop a compiler and runtime for the language. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).
                    C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen. The most recent version is 8.0, which was released in 2019 alongside Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3.</p>

                <h2>A small brief</h2>
                <p>
                    Private School University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Established in 1636 and named for its first benefactor, clergyman John Harvard, Harvard is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States
                    and among the most prestigious in the world.
                </p>
                <p>The Massachusetts colonial legislature, the General Court, authorized Harvard's founding. In its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational and Unitarian clergy, although it has never been formally affiliated with any
                    denomination. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil
                    War, President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities
                    in 1900. James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II; he liberalized admissions after the war.
